## 🚧 Future Updates (In Progress & Planned)

  Automatically detect bold, italic, underline, and link styles when pasting stylized text (e.g. from ChatGPT or Google Docs)

  Add clean, formatted title and paragraph sections without any image or button. Great for intros or updates

- ✋ **Drag & Move Email Blocks**  
  Visually reorder graphic/button/text sections with a simple drag-and-drop UI

- 🌈 **Emoji Support**  
  Native rendering for emojis in headlines and body text — no more manual PNG workarounds

- 🅱️ **Font Weight Options**  
  Select from Proxima Nova weights like Bold, Black, Semibold, etc., or auto-detect them from pasted text

- 📄 **One-Click Duplicate Sections**  
  Instantly clone graphic/button blocks with links, instead of rebuilding them manually

- 🔍 **Template Search & Filtering**  
  Add search or tag-based sorting to quickly find templates by type, date, or use-case

- 🧾 **Saved Snippets**  
  Create reusable callouts, disclaimers, RSVP text, and reuse them anywhere with one click
