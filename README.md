## 🚧 Future Updates (In Progress & Planned)

We're actively improving EmailMaker based on how TPA staff use it day to day.

### Coming Soon:

- 🧠 **Smart Style Recognition**  
  Automatically detect bold, italic, underline, and link styles when pasting stylized text (e.g. from ChatGPT or Google Docs)

- 🅰️ **Text-Only Sections**  
  Add clean, formatted title and paragraph sections without any image or button — great for intros or updates

- ✋ **Drag & Move Email Blocks**  
  Visually reorder graphic/button/text sections with a simple drag-and-drop UI

- 🌈 **Emoji Support**  
  Native rendering for emojis in headlines and body text — no more manual PNG workarounds

- 🅱️ **Font Weight Options**  
  Select from Proxima Nova weights like Bold, Black, Semibold, etc., or auto-detect them from pasted text

- 📄 **One-Click Duplicate Sections**  
  Instantly clone graphic/button blocks with links, instead of rebuilding them manually

- 🔍 **Template Search & Filtering**  
  Add search or tag-based sorting to quickly find templates by type, date, or use-case

- 🧾 **Saved Snippets**  
  Create reusable callouts, disclaimers, RSVP text, and reuse them anywhere with one click
